# Process File Microservice  

This module is a service that read & proces a **File** based on a input **Template File**. Its purpose is to read each of tlines contained in the file and perform the related operation and perform the required changes in the the **DataBase**.

This application exposes 2 single endpoints (as a RESTFul service) 
  1. One that check the health of srevice. 
  2. One that starts the process file action, with a customizable template. 


## How it works

1. The project includes a properties file  (**application.properties**), with the entries:  
   `file.sourcedir: To indicate where the file should be read`
   `mftp.credentials.host, mftp.credentials.port, mftp.credentials.user, mftp.credentials.pass: To indicate user credentials for MFTP server`
   `monitor.workdir.inbound: To indicate the source folder in witch scheduller will be reading the files`

2. On a daily basis, the module runs a scheduller customizable job that perform the next:  
     
3. Perform a conecction to a MFTP server with the provided host & credentials  
   
4. If the shceduller finds one or more files, this will select the **First File**, the one with the newest date in the customatizable folder.

5. At the end, **ms.transferfile** will be called sending the next information: 

{
    "status": 1,
    "msg":"SUCCESS",
    "file": "{fileName}"
}
